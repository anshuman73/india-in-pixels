## Cricket Player history data scraper

Scraper designed to get data about cricket players efficiently. Written as a part of a coding challenge for an (internship)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QzjQwgPcgQ].


### What I had to do

1. Get a list of all players alphabetically
2. Go to each player's profile and scrape all their runs
3. Cumulify the runs for each year


### What my code generates

1. ```all_player_data.json``` - This JSON file contains data of each match of each player alphabetically.
2. ```all_year_data.json``` - Contains year wise data of all players, tagged with their name and country, for usage of either to create growing visualisations.
